# Getting Started with Spike: Installation and Usage

## An Introduction to SPIKE: The RISC-V Instruction Set Simulator

With the rising adoption of the RISC-V architecture, developers and hardware engineers increasingly require dependable tools to simulate, test, and validate RISC-V designs—especially in the absence of physical hardware. One such essential tool in the RISC-V ecosystem is Spike, the official RISC-V Instruction Set Simulator (ISS).

### **What is SPIKE?**

Spike is an open-source Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) that models the behavior of RISC-V processors at the instruction level. Developed by the RISC-V Foundation, Spike acts as the golden model—or reference implementation—of the RISC-V architecture. It accurately simulates how a RISC-V core executes instructions, manipulates registers, and interacts with memory, enabling developers to verify the correctness of both hardware designs and software running on RISC-V platforms.

While Spike’s primary purpose is to simulate RISC-V processors, it supports a variety of configurations, including:

- **RV32I** – the 32-bit base integer instruction set
- **RV64I** – the 64-bit base integer instruction set
- Optional extensions such as **M** (integer multiplication and division), **A** (atomic operations), **F** (single-precision floating point), **D** (double-precision floating point), and others

Spike functions as a virtual RISC-V processor, executing instructions and enabling early-stage development, testing, and debugging—even in the absence of actual hardware. This makes it an essential tool for researchers, developers, and hardware designers working on RISC-V-based systems.

## **Main Functionalities of SPIKE**

**1. Instruction Set Simulation**

At its core, Spike is built to simulate the RISC-V instruction set in both 32-bit and 64-bit configurations. It offers a straightforward yet accurate emulation of how a RISC-V processor executes instructions, making it an ideal tool for gaining insight into the interaction between instructions, registers, and memory. Whether you're debugging low-level code or learning how RISC-V works internally, Spike provides a reliable and transparent reference model.

**2. Debugging and Verification**

Spike allows developers to closely observe the internal state of the processor during program execution. It provides access to registers, memory locations, and other key components of the processor’s state, making it especially useful for debugging both assembly code and high-level code compiled for RISC-V. As the official reference model, Spike serves as a reliable standard for comparing the behavior of real hardware against a trusted, architecture-compliant simulation.

**3. Toolchain Integration**

Spike integrates seamlessly with the RISC-V toolchain, including popular compilers like GCC and LLVM. Developers can compile RISC-V applications and run them directly within Spike to test functionality, performance, and correctness all without requiring physical hardware. This makes Spike a powerful tool for rapid prototyping and early-stage software development.

**4. Support for Custom Configurations**

Spike is highly configurable, allowing users to simulate various RISC-V implementations and optional extensions. For instance, you can emulate a processor with or without the M extension (for integer multiplication and division) or the F extension (for floating-point operations). This flexibility makes Spike an essential tool for diverse RISC-V projects, ranging from resource-constrained embedded systems to complex high-performance computing applications.

**5. Reference Model**

In addition to serving as a development tool, Spike functions as a golden reference model for validating custom hardware implementations of the RISC-V architecture. Hardware engineers often rely on Spike to compare the behavior of their designs against the expected output of a correctly functioning RISC-V processor. This comparison helps identify discrepancies early in the design process and ensures that the hardware conforms to the architectural specification.

## **Installing Spike: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Installing Spike is relatively straightforward, especially on Unix-like systems. The process involves setting up a few essential dependencies, configuring the environment, and building the tool from source. In this blog, we’ll guide you step-by-step through the installation process, explaining each stage to help you understand not just how, but also why each step is necessary.

**1. Updating System**

This updates the list of available packages and their versions to ensure your system is aware of the latest versions.

    sudo apt-get update

**2. Installing Dependencies**

This command installs the essential dependencies for building Spike. **Autoconf** and **automake** generate build configurations, while **gcc** and **g++** are the compilers needed for code compilation. **Git** helps clone the repository, and **libtool** simplifies handling shared libraries. Lastly, **zlib1g-dev** provides the compression library required for building components that need compression support.

    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gcc git g++ libtool zlib1g-dev

**3. Installing Device Tree Compiler**

This command installs the **Device Tree Compiler**, which is necessary for building the Spike simulator. The Device Tree Compiler is used to compile source code into binary representations for hardware configuration.

    sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

**4. Cloning the Spike Repository**

This command clones the **Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator** repository from GitHub. It fetches the latest source code needed to compile and install the Spike simulator.

    git clone https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim.git

This command will clone the latest version of Spike (currently **v1.1.1**).
However, if you want to build an older version, navigate to the cloned repository and run:

    git checkout v1.<version_tag>

For example, you can switch to one of the older available tags:

- v1.0.0
- v1.1.0

Replace **<version_tag>** with the specific version you want to install.

**5. Building Spike**

This navigates into the cloned Spike repository.

    cd riscv-isa-sim

This creates a new directory called **build** where the Spike simulator will be compiled.

    mkdir build

Moves into the newly created build directory.

    cd build

**6. Configuring and Compiling Spike**

This runs the configuration script to prepare for the build process. The --prefix=/opt/riscv argument specifies that the Spike simulator should be installed in the /opt/riscv directory.

    ../configure --prefix=/opt/riscv

The make command compiles the source code. The -j$(nproc) flag utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up the build process.

    make -j$(nproc)

This installs the compiled Spike binaries into the /opt/riscv directory.

    sudo make install

**7. Setting Up Environment Variables**

Navigates to your home directory.

    cd ~

Opens the .bashrc file in the **nano** text editor. The .bashrc file is a script that runs whenever you open a new terminal session. You’ll modify this file to include the newly installed Spike binaries in your system’s PATH.

    nano ~/.bashrc

**8. Adding Spike to PATH**

This command appends the directory /opt/riscv/bin to the system’s $PATH environment variable, ensuring that the Spike commands can be executed from any directory in the terminal.

    export PATH=/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH

After editing the .bashrc file, this command reloads it to apply the changes immediately.

    source ~/.bashrc

**9. Testing Spike**

This command checks whether Spike is installed correctly by displaying a help message. If Spike is correctly installed, this command will print a list of available options and usage information.

    spike --help

Verify whether the Spike proxy kernel (pk) is installed correctly, run the following command:

    which pk

If it returns a valid path (e.g., /opt/riscv/bin/pk), it means pk is installed and accessible via your environment.

If not, follow these steps to install it:

## **Installing SPIKE Proxy-Kernel**

 **1. Cloning the Proxy-Kernel Repository:**

This command clones the **RISC-V Proxy-Kernel** repository from GitHub. It fetches the latest source code needed to compile and install the Proxy-Kernel. 

    git clone https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk.git

**2. Building Proxy-Kernel**

This navigates into the cloned Spike repository.

    cd riscv-pk

This creates a new directory called **build** where the Spike simulator will be compiled.

    mkdir build

Moves into the newly created build directory.

    cd build

**3. Configuring and Compiling Spike**

This runs the configuration script to prepare for the build process. The --prefix=/opt/riscv argument specifies that the Spike simulator should be installed in the /opt/riscv directory and --host=riscv64-unknown-elf specifies that our system if of 64-Bit.

    ../configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --host=riscv64-unknown-elf

The make command compiles the source code. The -j$(nproc) flag utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up the build process.

    make -j$(nproc)

This installs the compiled Spike binaries into the /opt/riscv directory.

    sudo make install

**4. Adding Proxy-Kernel to PATH**

This command appends the directory /opt/riscv/bin to the system’s $PATH environment variable, ensuring that the pk commands can be executed from any directory in the terminal.

    export PATH=/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH

After editing the .bashrc file, this command reloads it to apply the changes immediately.

    source ~/.bashrc
    
## **Installing the RISC-V Toolchain**

After setting up Spike, you will need the RISC-V Toolchain to compile programs for RISC-V targets.

**1. Installing the RISC-V Toolchain**

This command installs the RISC-V **GCC cross-compiler** toolchain. It is used to compile C and C++ code for RISC-V targets. The gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf package allows compiling programs to run on the RISC-V ISA.

    sudo apt-get install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf

If this doesn’t work, you can manually install the latest version of the RISC-V toolchain compatible with your Ubuntu version from the official GitHub releases page:
👉 https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases

After downloading, extract the archive and add the bin directory of the extracted toolchain to your ~/.bashrc file. For example:

    export PATH=/path/to/your/toolchain/bin:$PATH

**2. Verifying the Installation**

This command checks if the RISC-V GCC toolchain was installed correctly by printing the version of the RISC-V GCC compiler. If the installation was successful, the toolchain version will be displayed in the terminal.

    riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version

## **SPIKE Usage and Commands**

SPIKE is a powerful tool for simulating RISC-V binaries. After successful installation and setup, you can start using SPIKE to run your compiled RISC-V applications.

The basic syntax to run a RISC-V binary with SPIKE is:

    spike pk <binary_file>

**Example:**

- Sample C Program (demo.c)

      int main() {
          int a = 5, b = 3;
          int c = a + b;
          return c;
      }

- Compile this C code with RISC-V GCC toolchain:

      riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -static -o demo demo.c

- View Disassembly of Binary:

      riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -D demo

- Now run it on SPIKE:

      spike pk demo

It doesn't show any output on the terminal as our code is not printing anything. However, we can see the value stored in the last register by using:

      echo $?

**Additional Options we can use on spike**

1. Simulate only a specific ISA (e.g., RV32I):

       spike --isa=RV32I pk demo

3. Enable logging:

        spike -l pk demo

This shows a log of instructions being executed.

4. Specify number of cores:

        spike -p2 pk demo
   
Simulates 2 processor cores.

5. Run SPIKE with memory size specification:

        spike -m1024 pk demo

Allocates 1024 MB of RAM to the simulation.

**Debugging RISC-V Programs in SPIKE**

SPIKE is not a traditional debugger, it provides debugging support through:

- Instruction-level logging (-l)
- Register dumps
- Integration with GDB via RSP

## **Conclusion**

By following the steps outlined above, you should now have a working installation of the Spike RISC-V ISA simulator, along with a solid understanding of how to compile, run, and debug RISC-V programs using it. Whether you're developing embedded applications, testing custom RISC-V extensions, or verifying hardware behavior, Spike provides a robust and flexible environment to support your work.
